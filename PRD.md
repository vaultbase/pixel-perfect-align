# Product Requirements Document: Pixel Perfect Align

## Executive Summary

A next-generation image alignment system that achieves pixel-perfect registration of high-resolution images with significant overlap, specifically optimized for Fujifilm GFX100S II medium format images.

## Problem Statement

Current image alignment solutions fail to achieve pixel-perfect alignment when dealing with:
- High-resolution medium format images (100+ megapixels)
- Complex lens distortions from wide-angle lenses
- Perspective changes in sequential captures
- Global consistency across multiple images

## Technical Requirements

### Core Alignment Engine

1. **Multi-Resolution Pyramid**
   - Fourier decomposition for frequency-based alignment
   - Start with low frequencies (coarse features)
   - Progress to high frequencies (fine details)

2. **Attention Mechanism**
   - Patch-based attention for robust feature matching
   - Handle repetitive patterns and textures
   - Weight contributions based on reliability

3. **Global Bundle Adjustment**
   - Simultaneous optimization of all image parameters
   - Energy minimization across entire image set
   - Consistency constraints between neighbors

4. **Distortion Model**
   - Radial distortion coefficients (k1, k2, k3, p1, p2)
   - Perspective transformation matrix
   - Per-image homography estimation

### Performance Requirements

- Process 20-50 images (each 100MP) in under 10 minutes
- Memory-efficient processing (streaming where possible)
- Multi-threaded/GPU acceleration when available

### Output Requirements

1. **Aligned Images**
   - 16-bit linear TIFF format
   - Full canvas size with black padding
   - Pixel-perfect registration

2. **Transform Data**
   - JSON export of all parameters
   - Homography matrices
   - Distortion coefficients
   - Global coordinate mapping

3. **Composite Generation**
   - Overlap averaging
   - Seamless blending
   - Exposure compensation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Core data structures and I/O
- Basic FFT-based alignment
- Multi-resolution pyramid

### Phase 2: Advanced Alignment (Week 2)
- Attention mechanism implementation
- Distortion parameter estimation
- Iterative refinement

### Phase 3: Global Optimization (Week 3)
- Bundle adjustment framework
- Constraint satisfaction
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Polish & Output (Week 4)
- Output generation pipeline
- Testing and validation
- Documentation

## Success Metrics

1. **Alignment Accuracy**
   - Sub-pixel registration error < 0.1 pixels
   - No visible seams in composites
   - Consistent global geometry

2. **Performance**
   - < 10 minutes for typical dataset
   - < 32GB RAM usage
   - Graceful degradation for larger sets

3. **Robustness**
   - Handle various overlap percentages (30-70%)
   - Work with different lens types
   - Recover from partial failures

## Technical Decisions

1. **Language**: Python with NumPy/SciPy for prototyping, critical paths in Numba/Cython
2. **Image Processing**: OpenCV for basics, custom implementations for advanced features
3. **Optimization**: scipy.optimize for bundle adjustment, custom gradient descent
4. **Parallelization**: multiprocessing for independent operations
5. **Storage**: Memory-mapped arrays for large images
